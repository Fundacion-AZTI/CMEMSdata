The data is available through the CMEMS website, but can also be accessed programmatically using the CMEMS API. The Copernicus Marine Toolbox is a free and easy-to-use tool that interoperates with the Copernicus Marine Data Store intending to cover any use case, from retrieval of metadata to a complete dataset, or just a subset, for any type of product: numerical models, satellite and/or in situ observations. It is written in Python, but All the data available are in NetCDF format. We provide examples of how to read and work with these files and merge them with other data sources. library(ggplot2) "],["download.html", "Chapter 2 Download 2.1 Installation", " Chapter 2 Download The Copernicus Marine Toolbox is written in Python, but it can be used in R through the reticulate package. For more information on how to use the Copernicus Marine Toolbox in R, see the official documentation. 2.1 Installation First, we need to install the reticulate package: install.packages(&quot;reticulate&quot;) Then, the package can be loaded: library(&quot;reticulate&quot;) Now we create a dedicated Python virtual environment for the Copernicus Marine Toolbox. Using a separate environment ensures a clean, isolated space where the package and its dependencies won’t interfere with other projects. The virtual environment has been created in virtualenv_create(envname = &quot;CopernicusMarine&quot;) virtualenv_install(&quot;CopernicusMarine&quot;, packages = c(&quot;copernicusmarine&quot;)) use_virtualenv(&quot;CopernicusMarine&quot;, required = TRUE) "],["see-structure-of-netcdf-files.html", "Chapter 3 See structure of NetCDF files", " Chapter 3 See structure of NetCDF files Write here a brief intro "],["read-and-work-with-netcdf-files.html", "Chapter 4 Read and work with NetCDF files", " Chapter 4 Read and work with NetCDF files Write here a brief intro "],["extract-the-information-from-the-netcdf-files.html", "Chapter 5 Extract the information from the NetCDF files", " Chapter 5 Extract the information from the NetCDF files Write here a brief intro "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
